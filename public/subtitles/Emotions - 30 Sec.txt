At Jersey Mike's they slice your order fresh right in front of you and let me tell you watching that can send a rush of emotions through a person. Excitement, impatience, baby-like wonder, indecisive, anticipatory chewing, nervous pacing, happy claps and finally jealousy because that's this guy's sub. I should order one.

Good idea. Sliced right in front of you. The Jersey Mike's thing.
